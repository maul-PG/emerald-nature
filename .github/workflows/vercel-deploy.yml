# To use this workflow:
# 1. Create a Personal Token on Vercel (Settings → Tokens) and add it as GitHub secret VERCEL_TOKEN
# 2. Find your Vercel Org ID and Project ID (from Vercel dashboard) and add them as secrets VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
# 3. Push to main — this workflow will deploy to Vercel (production)
